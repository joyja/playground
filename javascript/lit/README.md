Wanted to try out web components, but would like to stick to using vite. Followed [this tutorial](https://dev.to/herberthobregon/lit-simple-starter-kit-with-vitejs-typescript-2188) successfully to get a hello world.

I'm also curious about [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) and will probably give that a try in the Sveltekit playground of this repo.
